## Description

This React app has been built as part of the online React Course **React 16 - The Complete Guide** by **Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller**.

Note that I have coded along with the instructions: it is a pure copy of the 'Burger Builder' project in session 8 of the course.

### Section 8 
I have learned how to:

- Plan the structure of a React App: layout, component structure and state management
- Decide to implement stateful or stateless components and where to use state and props
- Use different components and media-queries in CSS files to account for mobile and desktop version
- Implement methods and use these in other components via props
- Implement click handlers
- Decide for a function syntax (i.e. arrow functions or not) according to a method's implementation
- Use CSS Modules (i.e. scope the CSS files to specific Components)
- Implement navigational components (like a Toolbar, and a SideDrawer for mobile)
- Implement higher-order components
- Implement images into the project
- ETC.

### Section 10 
I have learned how to:

- Create a Firebase Project
- Create an Axios instance
- Send a POST request to the firebase database
- Retrieve data from the backend (the firebase database)
- Use Interceptors
